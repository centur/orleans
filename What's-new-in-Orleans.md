## [v1.0.9](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.0.9) July 15th  2015

### This release includes several significant API changes that require adjustments in existing code created with v1.0.8 or earlier versions of Orleans  ###

**1. `GrainFactory` is not a static class anymore, so that the default implementation can be substituted for testing and other reasons.**

Within grain code one can still use code like `GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey)` because `Grain` class now has a `GrainFactory` property, which makes the above code translate to `base.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey)`. So no change is necessary for such code.

Within the client (frontend) context the default `GrainFactory` is available as a property on the `GrainClient` class. So, the code that used to be `GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey)` needs to be changed to `GrainClient.GrainFactory.GetGrain<IFoo>(grainKey)`

**2. `Read/Write/ClearStateAsync` methods methods that on grain state were moved from state objects to `Grain` class**

Wherever you have grain code like `this.State.WriteStateAsync()`, it needs to change to `this.WriteStateAsync()`. Similar adjustments need to be made to usage of `ReadeStateAsync()` and `CleareStateAsync()`.

**3. Binaries have been removed from the Orleans SDK**

If your projects still reference those binaries directly from the SDK folder, you need to switch to using [NuGet packages](Nugets) instead. If you are already consuming Orleans via NuGet, you are good.

**4. Local Silo test environment has been removed from the Orleans SDK**

If you were using the Local Silo environment from the SDK folder for testing your grains, you need to add a silo host project to your solution using the "Orleans Dev/Test Host" Visual Studio project template. Before you do that, make sure you install the [v1.0.9 version of the SDK](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/download/v1.0.9/orleans_setup.msi). Refer to [samples](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/tree/master/Samples) for examples of how that is done.

### Release notes

* Graceful shutdown of a silo with deactivation of all grains hosted in it.
* Support for Dependency Injection and better testability of grains: 
	* Direct instantiation of grains with passing `IGrainIdentity` and `IGrainRuntime` to constructor.
	* `IGrainRuntime` is a mockable interface that includes a set of system service interfaces, also mockable.
	* `GrainFactory` is a non-static class that is accessed via `base.GrainFactory`  from within a grain and via  `GrainClient.GrainFactory`  on the client.
* Deprecated generated per-interface `GetGrain()` static factory methods.
* Added support for concrete grain state classes, deprecated grain state interfaces and code generation of grain classes.
* Removed `Read/Write/ClearStateAsync` methods from `IGrainState` and moved them to `Grain<T>`.
* Performance optimizations of messaging with up to 40% improvements in throughput.
* Added ZooKeeper based cluster membership storage option.
* Removed compile time dependency on Microsoft.WindowsAzure.ServiceRuntime.dll.
* Consolidated dependencies on Azure in OrleansAzureUtils.dll, which is now optional.
* Refactored SQL system store to be more robust and vendor agnostic.
* Added streaming event deliver policy and failure reporting.
* Changed VS project templates to use only NuGet packages and not the SDK.
* Removed binaries and local silo environment from the SDK.
* Numerous bug fixes and other improvements.

## [v1.0.8](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v1.0.8) May 26th  2015

### Release notes

* Fixed versions of references Orleans NuGet packages to match the current one.
* Switched message header keys from strings to enums for performance.
* Fixed a deadlock issue in deactivation process.
* Added a NuGet package to simplify testing of grain projects - Microsoft.Orleans.TestingHost.
* Fixed regression of reporting codegen error to Visual Studio Errors window.
* Added version to SDK msi product and folder name.
* Other fixes and improvements.

## Orleans Open Source v1.0 Update (January 2015)

###Initial stable production-quality release.

Since the September 2014 Preview Update we have made a small number of public API changes, mainly related to clean up and more consistent naming. Those changes are summarized below:

### Public Type Names Changes

Old API   | New API
------------- | -------------
OrleansLogger | Logger
OrleansClient | GrainClient 
Grain.ActivateAsync | Grain.OnActivateAsync
Grain.DeactivateAsync | Grain.OnDeactivateAsync
Orleans.Host.OrleansSiloHost | Orleans.Runtime.Host.SiloHost 
Orleans.Host.OrleansAzureSilo | Orleans.Runtime.Host.AzureSilo
Orleans.Host.OrleansAzureClient| Orleans.Runtime.Host.zureClient
Orleans.Providers.IOrleansProvider | Orleans.Providers.IProvider
Orleans.Runtime.ActorRuntimeException | Orleans.Runtime.OrleansException
OrleansConfiguration | ClusterConfiguration
LoadAwarePlacementAttribute | ActivationCountBasedPlacementAttribute

### Other Changes

* All grain placement attribute (including [`StatelessWorker`]) now need to be defined on grain implementation class, rather than on grain interface.
* `LocalPlacementAttribute` was removed. There are now only `StatelessWorker` and `PreferLocalPlacement`.
* Support for Reactive programming with Async RX. 
* Orleans NuGet packages are now published on NuGet.org. 
  See this wiki page for advice on how to [convert legacy Orleans grain interface / class projects over to using NuGet packages](Convert-Orleans-v0.9-csproj-to-Use-v1.0-NuGet).
